# sliding_window_algorithm

##  Sliding Window Algorithm is a technique for reducing the complexity of algorithms. It is used such that the need for reusing the loops gets reduced and hence the program gets optimized. In this technique, we reuse the result of the previous step to compute the result of the next step.
